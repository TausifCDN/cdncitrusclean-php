                    <p>
                        In 2014, the seed of CDN Citrus Clean was planted. <b>There was a massive problem in the industrial sector.</b> Business owners had to use 10 to 20 different products just to get their cleaning done. On top of that, they were paying <b> EXORBITANT amounts of money </b> for harmful chemicals that smelled horrendous and didn’t work half the time! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>The Founder and CEO of CDN Citrus Clean, Colin George,</b> has run multiple successful companies and is a huge advocate of servitude. Since as far back as he could remember, he’s been focused on <b> serving and providing real, genuine value.</b> So, it comes as no surprise that as soon as he found the problem in the industrial cleaner market, he immediately set out to find a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The solution was squeezed into existence very soon afterwards! Colin was able to produce a unique, citrus based degreaser that smelled like a grove of oranges and worked on just about everything!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With his ground-breaking citrus degreaser and his 10 years of sales expertise, Colin set out across Alberta and Saskatchewan in his black Fiat to provide his solution to those who needed it. <b> Everyone from large oil and gas companies to the neighborhood deli immediately fell in love with the product and the person behind it.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to Colin’s dedication to solving a real problem,<b> over 2000 businesses have replaced entire shelves of products and saved tens of thousands of dollars every year!</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward to today. With a vastly expanded product line, some of the most popular retail partners, and a team of dedicated people who follow his principles, it’s safe to say that there is much more to expect from Colin and his team at CDN Citrus Clean!

                   <p>Our goal is simple. It is to<b> serve families and businesses in every way that we can. </b>One of the ways that we can do that is by <b>empowering every single person in North America to make a change in their cleaning habits. </b></p>
                   <p><i>“How do you suppose you’re going to do that?” </i> You might ask. There are multiple things that we do to ensure that you will make the right choice.</p>
                   <p><b>Our products are made in Canada and America. </b>Being a Canadian company, we understand the importance of things being made at home. When a product is made locally, it gives a mother or father a means to feed their family. It gives them a means to protect their family. So, when you buy one of our products, you’re not just buying a bottle of liquid that can clean your child’s spilled food. You’re helping someone else and <b>their</b> child have food and a place to call home.</p>
                   <p><b>We also know that you care about the environment. </b>You want there to be an earth left for your children and your children’s children. Because of that, we strive to provide people with bio-degradable, safer alternatives to harmful chemicals. By the way,<b> just because they’re safer, doesn’t mean they have to be expensive. </b>For us, it’s all about providing human beings with the right to choose. People shouldn’t have to pay a premium to be close to nature, and neither should you.</p>
                   <p><b>By making the switch today, you’re helping the world become a happier, cleaner, and more harmonious place. You’re helping people just like you improve their lives and the lives of others. </b>We’ll also eliminate all of the risk for you.
