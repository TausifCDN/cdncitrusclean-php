                        Imagine waking up at 5 in the morning. You’re getting yourself and the kids ready, checking the time every so often to make sure you’re moving quick enough. You scramble to the car for fear of being late. You arrive at work just on time. You work through the morning, and just as you begin to fully wake up, you start to feel the infamous mid-afternoon slump. Your 2:00PM coffee only made you more tired. You can’t wait to get home and relax. After arriving home, you open the door. As the door fully opens, you are terrified at what you see. Before you, stands a giant, menacing behemoth! It’s smelly. It’s the size of your house. Its 100 different shades of disgusting. It looks like something from a 1950s horror movie. You can barely see the floor! What a terrible mess! You wonder how you’ll ever find the time to keep your home clean while juggling all of your other responsibilities!
